### Meeting n°2

In terms of data sharing :
-	We agreed on sharing time series data in the EGO format (https://archimer.ifremer.fr/doc/00239/34980/) 
-	The EGO processing chain can be found here : https://www.seanoe.org/data/00343/45402/ 
-	We agreed on adding columns in this file format with the vertical velocities and glider navigation metadata (and uncertainties ?)
-	The Ocean Gliders Community github (https://github.com/OceanGlidersCommunity) was identified as the right place to create a new repository associated to vertical velocities (I was only following and not a member, I will get to create it as soon as I get in there !)
-	The data should be stored somewhere accessible to everyone (any ideas ?)

In terms of variables :
-	We need to come up with standardised names for 
o	the navigation parameters

o	vertical velocities associated with the flight models 

o	 vertical velocities associated with the ADCP measurements

We discussed several points linked to the vertical velocities with gliders, from the glider flight models and from ADCP measurements as well as its use for turbulence for which the flight model does not need to be as finely tuned. Using ADCP measurements for feedback on the flight model was also discussed. 

It was suggested to have a student look at a subset of the data (already processed) with examples form the different regions and platforms, in order to compare the statistics and scalings. It was stressed that we need to constrain our objectives in order to get the project going. First of all sharing data from already published missions in a common format to make sure we would be comparing the same things.

We discussed the importance of deadlines, and I would suggest another meeting in March, once the github is setup and we have discussed variable names.
It would also be good to confirm whether or not we will be organising a side event at the IUGC EGO conference in Gothenburg as previously suggested by Bastien.

### Meeting n°1

The main objective that came out of the discussion was to investigate the different scalings associated with latitude and the bottom reaching character of the convection.
We also discussed associated atmospheric patterns connecting convection sites (weather cant be bad everywhere at the same time) and Stratification increases in the preconditionning.
 
We also discussed the methods and different platforms, And looking at other vertical velocity events such as internal waves, symmetric instabilities, upwelling etc…
 
The main objective is to generate a dataset of deployments with vertical velocities, both from glider flight models and ADCPs in order to have someone look at it (one of us and or a Masters student)
 
To these means,
•	Nunzia
Has data in the adriatic Sea and in antarctica, over the span of several years
•	Bastien
Has ADCP data
Has data in the arabian sea, weddell and antarctica, but unlikely to have intense convection phenomena
•	Anthony
Has data over large spans of MLDs in the Mediterranean and Lofoten basins
•	Ailin and Kjetil
Have data in the Nordic Seas (greenland, Iceland and lofoten) associated with DC events
•	Louis
Has data in the Labrador Sea, is planning to redeploy there but maybe less in the convection patch 
•	Félix
Has data in the Med (with Pierre and Anthony from the pHD) spanning several years and intensities of convections. 
Has ADCP data, probably less likely associated with DC.
•	Pierre
Has data in the med
