# Vertical_Velocities_SOP

This [GitHub repository](https://github.com/OceanGlidersCommunity/Vertical_Velocities_SOP) is for the [OceanGliders](https://www.oceangliders.org) Vertical Velocities Standard Operating Procedure (SOP).

Everyone is welcome to join the SOP at any time. 

## Contributing

The idea is to create a common space to discuss and come up with SOPs relative to vertical velocities from different types of gliders, whether with a glider flight model or derived from ADCP measurements.
The first step will be to come up with variable names for these different fields, please discuss this (and other things) [here](https://github.com/OceanGlidersCommunity/Vertical_Velocities_SOP/discussions).

The aim is also to create a data repository associated to this gitspace, where data will be shared in the  [EGO format](https://archimer.ifremer.fr/doc/00239/34980/) with additional fields regarding the afore-mentioned vertical velocities as well as the navigation parameters necessary to their computation.
